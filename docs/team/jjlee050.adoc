== PROJECT: ClinicIO

---

== 1. Overview

The purpose of this project portfolio page is to showcase my work done and contributions made throughout the project.

ClinicIO is a project from CS2103T intended for students
to learn Software Engineering at an entry-level.

ClinicIO is a clinic management desktop application that allows receptionists can manage a clinic with ease and efficiency.
ClinicIO can be used to manage patient records, queues, medical inventory, appointments as well as view detailed statistics.

== 2. Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:
** Added *the ability to login/logout commands*
*** What it does: This feature allows the user to login to ClinicIO to gain access to ClinicIO record. Users can logout of ClinicIO to change account.
*** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
*** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
*** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
