This page showcases my contributions to a software engineering group project as part of a university module. ClinicIO is
 a desktop application to manage a clinic. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created
with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:
added *the ability to access detailed statistics and visualizations*
** What it does: allows the user to track the activity of a clinic through objective metrics, in a simple manner.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it provides a user with insight to make
decisions regarding the clinic's processes and improve efficiency.
** Highlights: This enhancement spans across the major functions of a clinic. It was a challenge to design and implement
a flexible yet powerful interface through which different types of visualizations can be easily created. This was done
in order to ensure that many more metrics can be programmed to be tracked in the future.

* *Minor enhancement*: added commands to export various types of patient data to a human editable format (CSV).

* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_
